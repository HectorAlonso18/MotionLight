# MotionLight

**MotionLight** is a light (668 KB) ``C++`` application developed using [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) to simulate and generate lineal motion profiles. Just like Trapezoidal and S-Curve profilers. 


>Motion control engineers spend hours optimizing tuning parameters for their servo-based motion controllers. But what if they are using step motors? And what if, no matter how much time they spend on tuning, they can‚Äôt get the performance they want?
>The answer, for many motor and control systems, is to focus on the motion profile instead.

On the other hand, with **MotionLight** you can create written ``.txt`` files, where you can use those files to implement the created motion profiles for you specific application.   

***At this moment, MotionLight is just available for Windows.***
