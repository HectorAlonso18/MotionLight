# General implementation
MotionLight can be applied across various systems to run motion profiles, so having a general solution is crucial. Below is a generalized pseudocode about how to work with the ``motion.light.txt`` files. 

For more information about ``motion.light`` file click [here](/MotionLight/docs/Tutorials/How_to_use_motion_light#the-motionlight-file)

1. You can create a function to read ``motion.light`` files
```c title="Pseudocode"
FUNCTION GetMotionLightVector(motion_file_name)

    // Open the file using the provided file name
    Open motion_file using motion_file_name

    // Check if the file is successfully opened
    IF motion_file is not open THEN
        PRINT "Error: unable to open file"
        RETURN empty vector
    END IF

    // Initialize an empty vector to store velocities
    velocities_vector = EMPTY VECTOR

    // Initialize an index to track line number
    line_index = 0

    // Read the file line by line
    WHILE there are lines left in the file DO
        Read current line

        // Ignore the first line
        IF line_index > 0 THEN
            // Convert the line to a float value
            velocity_value = Convert current line to float

            // Add the velocity value to the vector
            Append velocity_value to velocities_vector
        END IF

        // Increment the line index
        line_index = line_index + 1
    END WHILE

    // Return the velocities vector
    RETURN velocities_vector

END FUNCTION
```
2. Then just invoke the function and store the results in a vector or array. 
```c title="Pseudocode"
MAIN
    // Load the velocities from the motion light file into a vector
    velocity_vector = GetMotionLightVector("my_motion.light.txt"); 

    // Iterate through each velocity in the vector
    FOR EACH velocity IN velocity_vector
        // Move the motor using the corresponding velocity
        move_motor(velocity)
        
        // Wait for the sample time before moving to the next velocity
        // For delay time use the same value from your simulation!
        DELAY: sample time 

    ENDFOR

END
```
:::tip
Its highly recommend that you delay time be equal to the same sample time that you used in the MotionLight Simulation.

3. You may want to convert the motion.light fileÂ´s velocity to a motor velocity unit, like: RPM, rad/s, etc. 
```c title="Pseudocode"
MAIN
    // Load the velocities from the motion light file into a vector
    velocity_vector = GetMotionLightVector("my_motion.light.txt"); 
    
    // Motor diameter in meters
    Diameter = 1

    // Iterate through each velocity in the vector
    FOR EACH velocity IN velocity_vector
        
        // Example: Transform velocity in m/s to motor RPMs
        motor_velocity = (velocity * 60) / (PI * Diameter)

        // Move the motor using the corresponding velocity in RPM
        move_motor(motor_velocity)
        
        // Wait for the sample time before moving to the next velocity
        // For delay time use the same value from your simulation!
        DELAY: sample time 

    ENDFOR

END
```

Good ðŸ˜Š, with this generic example you are able to implement the MotionLight's files to your specific implementation. However, feel free to take a look to the other tutorials to see different specific implementations. 

On the other hand, you can always copy the velocity vector from the MotionLightÂ´s terminal to your code.
