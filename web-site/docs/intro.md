# MotionLight

**MotionLight** is a light ``C++`` application developed using ``Dear ImGui`` to simulate and generate lineal motion profiles. Just like Trapezoidal and S-Curve profilers. 

>Motion control engineers spend hours optimizing tuning parameters for their servo-based motion controllers. But what if they are using step motors? And what if, no matter how much time they spend on tuning, they can‚Äôt get the performance they want?
>The answer, for many motor and control systems, is to focus on the motion profile instead.

On the other hand, with **MotionLight** you can create written ``.txt`` files, where you can use those files to implement the created motion profiles for you specific application.   

:::note
At this moment, MotionLight is just available for Windows.

## Development
``MotionLight`` is develop by [H√©ctor Alonso](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hector-alonso-ibarra-012b51196/), creator of [Lightning](https://hectoralonso18.github.io/Lightninglib/docs/intro).

## Future Work
I am hoping to introduce more lineal motion profiles, also creating a stable version of MotionLight in Linux and MacOs.
